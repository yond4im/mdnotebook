# What is a Fake or Not in Electricity Systems?

It is very important to have a certain order of magnitude in mind. In this document, we will describe the most important facts and physical concepts about electrical energy.

Electricity sector is the largest global driver of carbon emissions – responsible for less than 40 % of CO<sub>2</sub> and most likely a big part of fugitive methane. Any plan to decarbonize our economy has to take the power sector into account. Even in its heart of implementation. Not only is the biggest source of emissions, but it is also the one with the most market-ready solutions.

Before we start, some definitions are important to clarify...

- The term *electricity systems* refers to the procurement of fuels and raw materials for electric grid components; the generation and storage of electricity; and the delivery of electricity to end-use consumers.
  
- The term *low-carbon energy generation* is the production of electricity with substantially lower greenhouse gas emissions than conventional fossil fuel power generation. Low-carbon energy sources include wind power, solar power, nuclear power, and most hydropower. The term is relative, and the emissions threshold for what constitutes low-carbon varies depending on the source. For example, the International Energy Agency (IEA) defines low-carbon electricity as electricity produced with less than 50 grams of CO2 emissions per kilowatt-hour (kWh). Low-carbon energy generation is important for mitigating climate change. The power sector is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, and switching to low-carbon sources of electricity can help to reduce these emissions.

- The term *smart grid* defines an advanced, intelligent electric system that has the ability to provide real-time insights and control for the grid, including distribution grid, grid-edge and behind the meter assets for utilities and consumers, on energy demand/supply and grid operations.

## How are we going to produce electricity in a clean way?

Climate change is one of the greatest threats to humanity, biodiversity, and eco-systems in the 21st century. With the electricity sector accounting for a quarter of human emissions and around 42 % of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, any transition to climate change or a low-carbon economy will need to place the power grid industry at the heart of its solution.

Before the COVID-19 crisis (2018-2019), the total electric power generated worldwide was around 26,000 TWh with 10 % nuclear, 63 % fossil fuels (37 % coal and 23 % gas), and 26 % renewables (16 % hydro, 4.8 % wind, and 2.2 % solar).

According to the last [IEA's figures](https://www.iea.org/energy-system/electricity#sources-of-electricity):

**Coal**: They still account for just over a third of the world's electricity production, despite being the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel.
  
**Natural gas**: In 2022, gas-fired power generation remains relatively unchanged from 2021, accounting for over 20 % of global electricity production.

**Nuclear**: It is a major source of low-emission electricity, accounting for around 10 % of the world's electricity production.

**Hydropower**: It currently generates more electricity than all other renewable technologies combined, and is set to remain the world's largest source of renewable electricity generation in the 2030s. It accounts for 15 % of the global electricity mix.

**Wind**: This electricity source remains the leading non-hydro renewable technology, with a record increase in production in 2022. It accounts for 6.6 % of the global electricity mix.

**Solar PV**: Solar photovoltaic electricity production saw another record increase in 2022, putting the technology on track to meet the 2030 targets under the NZE scenario. It accounts for 3.5 % of the global electricity mix.

**Other renewables (to be defined)**: They account for 3 % of the global electricity mix.

According to the last World Energy Outlook (WEO 2022 Table 6.1, p. 281), the global electricity production is about 28,334 TWh and a renewables share of 28 %.

Check the figures above:

- [ ] According to the IPCC AR6, WGIII report: *The electricity sector remains the single largest source of energy sector CO2 emissions, accounting for about 36% in 2019*.
- [ ] According to the [IEA](https://www.iea.org/topics/climate-change): *Power generation is the largest emissions driver*:
  > Power generation and transport together accounted for over two thirds of total emissions in 2019 and have been responsible for almost all global growth since 2010. The remaining third was mainly associated with the industry and buildings sectors.
  
  > After allocating electricity and heat emissions to final sectors, industry continued to be the largest emitting sector, with over 40% of global emissions in 2019. Emissions in the transport sector increased to account for 27% of the global emissions in 2019, while buildings related emissions slightly decreased to represent 25% of global emissions in 2019.

# The Myths about Nuclear Power

> Nuclear power plants are often inflexible since they can take hours or days to turn off and are often left on (at full capacity) to operate as baseload.

This is not true for all countries running nuclear power plants to generate electricity through their grid. For instance, in France, nuclear plants get flexibility to change their electricity generation for load-following and other electricity grid services.

# The Myths about the Smart Grid

According to the [IEA's (International Energy Agency) definition](https://www.iea.org/energy-system/electricity/smart-grids) smart grids *are electricity network that use digital technologies, sensors and software to better match the supply and demand of eletricity in real time while minmizing costs and maintaining the stability and reliability of the grid*.

The smart grid projects seek to adapt consumption to production, which includes an increasingly important part of non-dispatchable renewable energies, also relying on storage systems and taking into account the planned development for electric vehicles. 

Most of the projects, still in the R&D stage for the most part, integrate dimensions of *digitalization*, adaptation of electrical equipment, telecommunications, with more and more connected objects that make it possible to envisage an *intelligent* regulation of their consumption.

Smart grids use information and communication technologies to collect data on energy production and consumption.

These data are then used to improve the efficiency of the power grid, by adjusting energy production and distribution according to need.

Smart grids can also help integrate renewable energies, which are non-controllable sources of energy, into the power grid.

Smart grids can also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, by optimizing energy use and encouraging consumers to reduce their consumption.

Smart grids are still in development, but they have the potential to revolutionize the energy sector. They can help make the power grid more efficient, reliable and environmentally friendly.

# Other fact checking piece of information

A former colleague in industry claimed the following about the IEA:

> IEA calculates for historical reasons primary energy. This is how much total energy is sourced. Take, the example of coal: to generate one Wh of electricity, one needs X units of energy of coal. To produce that electricity, one actually burns the coal, which boils the water, which turns a turbine, which generates electricity. A vast amount of primary energy is thus wasted with fossil fuels sources and also nuclear energy.

In my understanding and opinion, this was the case with [Statistical Review of World Energy](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html). 

In one of the last released book named "How the World Really Works" (2022), Vaclav Smil explains the following:

> Global primary energy supply usually refers to total (gross) production, but it is more revealing to look at energy that is actually available for conversion into useful forms. To do this, we need to substract pre-consumption losses (during coal sorting and cleaning, crude oil refining, and natural gas processing), non-energy use (mainly as feedstocks for chemical industries, and also as lubricating oils for machines ranging from pumps to aircraft turbines and as paving materials), and losses during electricity transmission.

> Electricity is only 18 percent of total final global energy consumption, and the decarbonization of more than 80 percent of final energy uses—by industries, households, commerce, and transportation—will be even more challenging than the decarbonization of electricity generation.

## TODO NEXT
