# What is a Fake or Not in Electricity Markets?

In this part, we will go through the benefits and drawbacks of electricity market liberalization and deregulation. This will be compared to monopole and regulated market design.

## The merit order model and marginal pricing

These two terms can be confusing to many people involved in the subject of electricity market design.

According to a renowned scientist specializing in power system economics, renewable energy, electricity markets, and energy system modeling:

> Marginal pricing refers to electricity prices being set by the variable cost of the marginal plant, i.e. the most expensive plant that is required to serve demand. This is the way electricity prices are determined on short-term wholesale markets, such as the day-ahead market.

In other words, the *system marginal price* (SMP) is the definition of the market clearing price which represents the price of one additional megawatt-hour (MWh) of energy. Generators or power plant owners receive this SMP for each MWh they produce, while consumers pay the SMP for each megawatt-hour they consume, regardless of the bids they have submitted.

### Debunk n°1: marginal pricing is not unique to power markets

> Commodities price on the margin, and so does electricity. Oil, gas, copper, milk, solar panels — they are all subject to marginal pricing.

> In fact "merit order curve" is just a complicated name for what is conventionally called the "supply curve". The Merit order Model is just the supply-demand model that most of you have seen many times.

TODO NEXT:

- [ ] This maybe the main caveats of current electricity market design, is it possible to make a confusion between common goods like energy with foods and other commercial products in the economy?
- [ ] Check if the new electricity market design discussed at the European Commission is tackling this problem.

### Debunk n°2: marginal pricing is not an artificial rule of the market design

> It is not a rule that some institution or person came up with. It's not an arbitrary choice among alternative "market designs". It is the natural way prices emerge in free markets.

### Debunk n°3: the merit order model is descriptive

> The merit order model is not an instruction of how markets ought to function, but a description of how individual decisions lead to market outcomes.

### Debunk n°4: the power prices is not coupled to the gas with by law

> The talk of "de-coupling" power prices from gas prices has led people to believe there is a law or a rule that connects those prices. There is not.

TODO NEXT:

- [ ] Dig a little deeper into this statement.

### Debunk n°5: there isn't "the one" power price. There is a different price in every quarter-hour

> The one crucial difference between electricity and other commodities is that power, unlike wheat, cannot be stored. So the market-clearing price on spot markets varies on time scales of minutes, and widely so.

### Debunk n°6: margins pay for investments

> Power stations left of the marginal plant will earn a "contribution margin". These margins are necessary to finance investments. Economically, profits arise if contribution margins exceed what's necessary to recover investment costs.
